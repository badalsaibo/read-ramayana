The city of   Lanka was shone by buildings equaling autumnal clouds. With a sound resembling that   of an ocean, it was served by ocean breeze. It was filled with well fed and mighty armies like Vitapati,   the capital of Kubera. It had elephants positioned at archways and had white gates and archways. Quickly   approaching that city of Lanka which was protected by Rakshasas, like the auspicious city of Bhogavati   being protected by serpents moving about, spread with cloud illumined by flashes of lightening, served by   pathways of stars, with a light breeze like the Indra's city of Amaravati, surrounded by a wall   with a golden hue, decorated by flags with sounds from groups of small bells. He became happy and leapt up   the wall."

Thereafter Hanuman the monkey,   became happy seeing the doors which were of golden color, with platforms of cat's eye gems, inlaid with diamonds,   crystals and pearls, embellished with floors of gems, graced with elephants made of refined gold, crowned   with spotless white silver, stairs studded with cat's eye gems, with inside walls made of crystal free from   dust, provided with lovely assembly halls, with sounds of Krauncha birds and peacocks, served by royal   swans, looking as though flying toward the sky, with auspicious houses resounding everywhere with the sounds   of clarionets and ornaments, equaling the city of Vasvaukasaara, as though flying towards the   sky."

This land may be conquerable by Kumuda or Angada, to the great monkey Sushena or to   Mainda or Dvivida. There may be access to this land to the son of Sun God Sugreeva, to the monkey   Kusaparvana, to the chief among monkeys Riksha and to me.\" Considering the long armed Sri Rama's   strength and Lakshmana's valour, Hanuman became happy."

Due to the lamps that illuminated the radiant great houses, all darkness was lost. Thereafter, the guardian   of that city, in her own form, saw Hanuman, the best among monkeys and the mighty one,   entering. Seeing that best among monkeys Hanuman there, that Lanka ruled by Ravana,   rose up herself with a horrific appearance of face an eyes. She stood in front of the best among Vanaras   Hanuman. She made a great sound and spoke to Hanuman thus. \"O one who lives in gardens!   Who are you? For what reason did you come here? As long as your lives are sustained, tell me the truth here   before that. It is indeed not possible for you to enter this city of Lanka  which is protected by Ravana's forces and strongly guarded all around.\""

Then that tiger among Vanaras, the powerful son of Vayu,   being hit powerfully by Lanka made a great sound. Hanuman became dizzy with anger and folded his fingers   of left hand. He then hit her with His fist. \"She is a woman\" - thinking thus He did not   show much anger by Himself. That demon fell on land immediately by that hit with a distressed body   and appeared with a horrific face. Then the intellectual and glorious Hanuman saw her fallen down and thinking   her to be woman, showed kindness. Lanka being very gloomy spoke with a flattering tone without pride these   words to Hanuman the Vanara. "

I am myself the city of   Lanka. I am defeated by your strength. In earlier times I had been given a boon by   Lord Brahma. Hear from me about this matter. Let this be known by you - whenever a Vanara conquers   you with his might, then a fear will come for Rakshasas. O gentle one! With   your appearance now, that time has come for me. Ordinance of Brahma is the truth and is immutable. The destruction   has come for Ravana the evil minded king and to all Rakshasas due to Sita. For that reason, enter   the city of Lanka  ruled by Ravana and do here whatever tasks you want to. Enter the auspicious city of   Lanka stuck by the curse, ruled by the king of Rakshasas, roam everywhere and   search for the chaste wife Sita according to your comfort.\""

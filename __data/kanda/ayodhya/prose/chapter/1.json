Treated with good hospitality and paternal love by his maternal uncle, Yudhajit, who was a lord of cavalry, Bharatha stayed with his brother there. Those heroes of valour Bharatha and Satrughna, though staying there enjoying all the comforts, were remembering their age old father. The mighty Dasharatha was also often remembering his sons Bharatha and Satrughna who were out of his state and who were equivalent to Indra and Varuna."

Rama, like the Brahma among all the living beings, the most virtuous among those brothers and the mightiest was a great source of joy for his father. That Rama - was He not the eternal Vishnu who was born on earth as prayed by celestials to kill the egoistic Ravana?"

By virtues, he was like Dasharatha. In this way, he was an incomparable son on earth. That Rama was always peaceful in mind and spoke softly. He did not react to the hard words spoken by others. That Rama, because of his good bent of mind, feels glad even by whatever way a good thing is done to him. He does not remember any number of bad things done to him. Whenever he finds some time even while practising archery, Rama used to converse with elderly people, elder by way of conduct or wisdom or age or with good- natured people."

Like v\u00e4chaspathi, his eloquent speech contained a series of strategies for action. Rama was a young man without any disease. He was a good speaker. He had a good body.
